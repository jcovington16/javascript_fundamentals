# JavaScript_Practice
- Simply revisiting JavaScript and starting all the way from the beginning and working my way to more complex exercises.
- Will go through the fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript before I get more hands on with the different frameworks. 
- Will focus on 1 to 3 small exercises a day to push back into this repo. 

- I love JavaScript and I want to continue to develop as a full stack engineer. I never want to scope myself to one thing.
